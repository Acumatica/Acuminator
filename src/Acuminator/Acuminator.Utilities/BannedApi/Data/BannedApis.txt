M:System-Math.Round(System.Double) General Math.Round uses Bankers Rounding by default, which rounds to the closest even number. Usually, this is not the desired rounding behavior. Use Math.Round overload with MidpointRounding parameter to explicitly specify the desired rounding behavior.
M:System.Math.Round(System.Decimal) General Math.Round uses Bankers Rounding by default, which rounds to the closest even number. Usually, this is not the desired rounding behavior. Use Math.Round overload with MidpointRounding parameter to explicitly specify the desired rounding behavior.
