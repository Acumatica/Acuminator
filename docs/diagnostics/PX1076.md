This document describes the PX1076 diagnostic.

## Summary

| Code   | Short Description                                                                                                                                   | Type  | Code Fix    | 
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ----------- | 
| PX1076 | This code calls Acumatica internal API marked with PXInternalUseOnlyAttribute which is not intended for public use | Warning | Unavailable |

## Diagnostic Description
The external code developed using Acumatica ERP DLLs must not use members declared with the PXInternalUseOnly attribute. 

The PXInternalUseOnly attribute is used to define public members in Acumatica ERP DLLs that are not intended for public use. Such members have the public access modifier for technical purposes only.

## Example of Incorrect Code

Suppose, the following member is declared in the PX.Data namespace.

```C#
public static class PXDatabase
{
        [PXInternalUseOnly]
        public static byte[] SelectCrossCompanyTimeStamp()
        {
            return Provider.SelectCrossCompanyTimeStamp();
        }
}
```

The diagnostic is displayed for the following code which uses the member declared in `PX.Data`. Such code can be in the externally owned code (for example, in an ISV solution).

```
var timestamp = PXDatabase.SelectCrossCompanyTimeStamp();
```
