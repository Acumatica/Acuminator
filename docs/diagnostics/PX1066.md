# PX1066
This document describes the PX1066 diagnostic.

## Summary

| Code   | Short Description                                                                         | Type                                 | Code Fix    | 
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------- | 
| PX1066 | There is probably a typo in the DAC BQL field name.                                       | Warning (ISV Level 3: Informational) | Available   | 

## Diagnostic Description

The DAC BQL field must have the same name as the corresponding DAC field property but with the first letter in a different case (uppercase for DAC field properties and lowercase for DAC BQL fields).
The diagnostic does not check declared in DAC C# properties without Acumatica attributes declared on them. Such properties are not considered as DAC field properties.

The PX1066 diagnostic usually combines with the [PX1065](PX1065.md) diagnostic. The PX1065 diagnostic reports that the DAC field property does not have a corresponding DAC BQL field. 
The PX1066 diagnostic amplifies it by reporting DAC BQL fields with possible typos that have names close to the name of such DAC field property.

There is also another scenario when the PX1066 diagnostic can be raised. It is when there are two DACs, one derived from another, and there is a DAC BQL field without a corresponding property in the derived DAC.
The diagnostic will try to check if there is a mistype in this BQL field and suggest names of DAC field properties from the base DAC.

### Terminology

This section is a reminder about the terminology used in the diagnostic description. Feel free to skip it if you are already familiar with it.

A **DAC field property** is any C# property declared in a DAC that have attributes derived from `PX.Data.PXEventSubscriberAttribute`.
Such attributes sometimes are called *Acumatica attributes* for brewity. 

A DAC BQL field is a public abstract class that implements `PX.Data.IBqlField` interface. It usually has a corresponding DAC field property that has the same name but in a different casing. 
Usually, BQL fields use camelCasing and field properites use PascalCasing. Together such pair forms a **DAC field**. Here is an example of a DAC field:
```C#
public class DAC : PXBqlTable
{
	public abstract class orderNbr : PX.Data.BQL.BqlString.Field<orderNbr> { }  // The DAC BQL field

	[PXDBString( IsKey = true, IsUnicode = true, InputMask = ">CCCCCC")]		// The Acumatica attribute
	public virtual string OrderNbr { get; set; }								// The DAC field property 

	// Not a DAC field property at all
	public string SomeProperty  
	{ 
		get; 
		set;
	}
}
```

## Code Fix Description

The code fix changes the name of the DAC BQL field in the solution so that it matches the name of the DAC field property.

### Example of Incorrect Code

```C#
[PXHidden]
public class Dac : PXBqlTable
{
	public abstract class nteID : PX.Data.BQL.BqlGuid.Field<nteID> { }

	[PXGuid]
	public Guid? NoteID { get; set; }
}
```

### Example of the Code Fix

```C#
[PXHidden]
public class Dac : PXBqlTable
{
	public abstract class noteID : PX.Data.BQL.BqlGuid.Field<noteID> { }

	[PXGuid]
	public Guid? NoteID { get; set; }
}
```
