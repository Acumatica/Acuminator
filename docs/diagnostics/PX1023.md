# PX1023
This document describes the PX1023 diagnostic.

## Summary

| Code   | Short Description                                          | Type  | Code Fix  | 
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | --------- | 
| PX1023 | The DAC property is marked with multiple field attributes. | Error | Available |

## Diagnostic Description
The diagnostic verifies the following rules:

 - The DAC property field must have only one field type attribute, such as `PXDBBool` or `PXInt`. 
 - The DAC property field cannot have multiple special attributes, such as `PXDBCalced` and `PXDBScalar`.
 - If the DAC property has an attribute derived from the `PXAggregateAttribute`, this attribute cannot aggregate incompatible field type attributes (such as `PXBool` and `PXInt) or multiple special attributes.

The code fix does the following:
 - For a field type attribute, leaves the selected attribute and removes all other field type attributes
 - For a special attribute, leaves the selected attribute and removes all other special attributes

The code fix is not available for the errors found for the attributes derived from the `PXAggregateAttribute`.

## Example of Incorrect Code

```C#
public class DAC: IBqlTable
{
    #region Property
    public abstract class property : IBqlField {    }
 
    [PXDBBool]    // The PX1023 error is displayed for this line.
    [PXInt]       // The PX1023 error is also displayed for this line.
    // Either PXDBBool or PXInt must be removed.
    public virtual bool? Property{ get; set; }
    #endregion
}
```

## Example of Code Fix

```C#
public class DAC: IBqlTable
{
    #region Property
    public abstract class property : IBqlField {    }
 
    [PXDBBool]
    public virtual bool? Property{ get; set; }
    #endregion
}
```
