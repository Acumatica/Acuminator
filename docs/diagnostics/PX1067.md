This document describes the PX1067 diagnostic.

## Summary

| Code   | Short Description                                                                         | Type                                 | Code Fix    | 
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------- | 
| PX1067 | The DAC does not contain a redeclaration of a BQL field declared in the base DAC.             | Warning (ISV Level 3: Informational) | Available   | 

## Diagnostic Description

In Acumatica Framework, BQL fields from a base DAC should be redeclared in the derived DAC. If a BQL field was not redeclared in the derived DAC, using this field in a BQL query with a derived DAC can lead to a runtime error.
The PX1067 diagnostic reports a warning if a DAC does not contain a redeclaration of a BQL field that is declared in the base DAC.

This diagnostic reports a warning instead of an error because the absence of a BQL field redeclaration in a derived DAC does not always lead to a runtime error. 
An error will happen only if the BQL field is used in a BQL query with the derived DAC. However, the best practice is to redeclare all BQL fields in the derived DAC because they can be always used in a BQL query with the derived DAC in an external customization.

## Code Fix Description

The code fix adds the redeclaration of a BQL field declared in the base DAC to the derived DAC. If the BQL field in the base DAC is weakly typed (for example, if it only implements the `PX.Data.IBqlField` interface), the code fix will attempt to add a strongly typed declaration of the BQL field. The type of the BQL field will be deduced from the corresponding DAC field property type.

### Example of Incorrect Code

```C#
[PXHidden]
public class DerivedDac : BaseDac
{
}

[PXHidden]
public class BaseDac : PXBqlTable, IBqlTable
{
	public abstract class noteID : PX.Data.BQL.BqlGuid.Field<noteID> { }

	[PXGuid]
	public Guid? NoteID { get; set; }
}
```

### Example of the Code Fix

```C#
[PXHidden]
public class DerivedDac : BaseDac
{
	public new abstract class noteID : PX.Data.BQL.BqlGuid.Field<noteID> { }
}

[PXHidden]
public class BaseDac : PXBqlTable, IBqlTable
{
	public abstract class noteID : PX.Data.BQL.BqlGuid.Field<noteID> { }

	[PXGuid]
	public Guid? NoteID { get; set; }
}
```
