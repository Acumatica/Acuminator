This document describes the PX1067 diagnostic.

## Summary

| Code   | Short Description                                                                         | Type                                 | Code Fix    | 
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------- | 
| PX1067 | DAC does not contain a redeclaration of a BQL field declared in the base DAC.             | Warning (ISV Level 3: Informational) | Available   | 

## Diagnostic Description

In Acumatica Framework BQL fields from base DACs should be redeclared in the derived DAC. Otherwise, the usage of not redeclared BQL fields in a BQL query with a derived DAC can lead to a runtime error.
The PX1067 diagnostic reports a warning if DAC does not contain a redeclaration of a BQL field that is declared in the base DAC.

The reason PX1067 diagnostic reports a warning instead of an error is that the absence of a BQL field redeclaration in a derived DAC is not always leading to a runtime error. 
An error will happen only if the BQL field is used in a BQL query with the derived DAC. However, the best practice is to redeclare all BQL fields in the derived DAC because they can be always used in a BQL query 
with the derived DAC in the external customization.

## Code Fix Description

The code fix adds the redeclaration of a BQL field declared in the base DAC to the derived DAC. If the BQL field in the base DAC is weakly typed (e.g. only implements the `PX.Data.IBqlField` interface), 
the code fix will attempt to add a strongly typed BQL field declaration with type deduced from the corresponding DAC field property type.

### Example of Incorrect Code

```C#
[PXHidden]
public class DerivedDac : BaseDac
{
}

[PXHidden]
public class BaseDac : PXBqlTable, IBqlTable
{
	public abstract class noteID : PX.Data.BQL.BqlGuid.Field<noteID> { }

	[PXGuid]
	public Guid? NoteID { get; set; }
}
```

### Example of the Code Fix

```C#
[PXHidden]
public class DerivedDac : BaseDac
{
	public new abstract class noteID : PX.Data.BQL.BqlGuid.Field<noteID> { }
}

[PXHidden]
public class BaseDac : PXBqlTable, IBqlTable
{
	public abstract class noteID : PX.Data.BQL.BqlGuid.Field<noteID> { }

	[PXGuid]
	public Guid? NoteID { get; set; }
}
```
