# PX1007
This document describes the PX1007 diagnostic.

## Summary

| Code   | Short Description                                   | Type                             | Code Fix  | 
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------| -------------------------------- | --------- | 
| PX1007 | A public entity or DAC property should have a description in the `summary` XML tag. | Warning | Available | 

## Diagnostic Description
Any public class, interface, structure, enumeration, delegate, or their member that is defined in a `PX` namespace (such as the `PX.Objects.AR` namespace) should have a description in the `summary` XML tag. These descriptions can be used for building the API and DAC references for the Acumatica ERP libraries.

The code fix does one of the following:

 - Adds the `summary` XML tags, in which you type the description of the code item
 - Adds the `exclude` XML tag, which excludes the item from the API and DAC References

The diagnostic is currently displayed for all public entities (classes, interfaces, structures, enumerations, and delegates) and DAC property fields. The diagnostic is not displayed for other fields, properties, and methods of public entities. 

The diagnostic is not displayed for child classes if their parent class has the `exclude` XML tag.

This diagnostic is intended only for Acumatica ERP developers. Developers of customization packages can pay no attention to this diagnostic.

## Example of Code that Results in the Warning

```C#
namespace PX.Objects.AR
{
    public class ARReleaseProcess_Extension : PXGraphExtension<ARReleaseProcess> // The PX1007 warning is displayed for this line.
    {
        ...
    }
}
```

## Example of Code Fix (A Description is Added)

```C#
namespace PX.Objects.AR
{
    /// <summary>
    /// The base exception for redirection to a webpage.
    /// </summary>
    public abstract class PXBaseRedirectException : PXException
    {
        ...
    }
}
```

## Example of Code Fix (The Item Is Excluded)

```C#
namespace PX.Objects.AR
{
    /// <exclude/>
    public abstract class PXBaseRedirectException : PXException
    {
        ...
    }
}
```
