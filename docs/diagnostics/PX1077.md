# PX1077
This document describes the PX1077 diagnostic.

## Summary

| Code   | Short Description                                         | Type  | Code Fix    | 
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ----------- | 
| PX1077 | Event handlers cannot have `private` accessibility level. | Error | Unavailable | 

## Diagnostic Description
The accessibility level of an event handler cannot be `private`.
Private event handlers can lead to unexpected behavior, and are not guaranteed to be called by the Acumatica Framework.

## Further Notes
* Acuminator will propose a fix to make the method `protected`.
* The best practice is to make the event handlers `protected` and `virtual` (or `override`), and to avoid setting them as `sealed`. This best practice is covered by the [PX1078](diagnostics/PX1078.md) diagnostic.

## Example of Correct Code
The following example demonstrates the correct implementation of an event handler.
```C#
public class MyGraph : PXGraph<MyGraph>
{
}

public class MyGraphExtension : PXGraphExtension<MyGraph>
{
	protected virtual void _(Events.FieldUpdated<PX.Objects.AR.ARInvoice.docType> e)
	{
	}
}
```

## Example of Incorrect Code
In the following example, the access modifier is `private`.

```C#
public class MyGraph : PXGraph<MyGraph>
{
}

public class MyGraphExtension : PXGraphExtension<MyGraph>
{
	private void _(Events.FieldUpdated<PX.Objects.AR.ARInvoice.docType> e)
	{
	}
}
```
