# PX1062
This document describes the PX1062 diagnostic.

## Summary

| Code   | Short Description                                                                         | Type                           | Code Fix    | 
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------- | 
| PX1062 | You cannot declare static views, actions, mutable fields, and properties in graphs or graph extensions | Error | Available | 

## Diagnostic Description

In graphs and graph extensions, it is strictly forbidden to use static members, such as actions, views, mutable properties, and mutable fields. The diagnostic shows the error for these static members.

The diagnostic behavior and the code fix depend on the type of field or property as follows:
 - For a static view or action, the diagnostic always reports an error. The only available code fix is to remove the static keyword. Even if the action or view is read-only, it is still forbidden.
 - Other static fields and properties are reported only if they are mutable (not read-only). In that case, two code fixes are available:
   - Make the field or property read-only. Note that the fix works differently for fields and properties. For a field, the fix adds the `readonly` modifier. For a property, the fix removes the property setter.
   - Remove the `static` modifier.

## Example of Incorrect Code

```C#
public class SomeGraph : PXGraph<SomeGraph>
{
    public static int SalesSubMask;

    public static PXAction<PX.Objects.AR.ARInvoice> Release;

    public static IFinPeriodRepository FinPeriodRepository { get; set; }
}
```

## Example of the Code Fix

```C#
public class SomeGraph : PXGraph<SomeGraph>
{
	// the fix added the readonly modifier
    public static readonly int SalesSubMask;

	// the fix removed the static modifier
    public PXAction<PX.Objects.AR.ARInvoice> Release;

	// the fix removed the static modifier
    public IFinPeriodRepository FinPeriodRepository { get; set; }
}
```
