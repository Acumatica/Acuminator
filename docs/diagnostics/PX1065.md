| PX1065 | The DAC field property does not have a corresponding DAC BQL field.                       | Error                          | Available   | 

## Diagnostic Description

Acumatica Framework requires that all DAC field properties have a corresponding DAC BQL field. Without a corresponding DAC BQL field. Missing BQL fields may cause runtime errors or unexpected behavior in 
numerous places in the Acumatica ERP application. 

The PX1065 diagnostic checks whether the DAC field property has a corresponding DAC BQL field in the DAC type or in its base DACs.

For DAC extensions, the diagnostic checks whether the DAC field property has a corresponding DAC BQL field in the following locations:
 - DAC extension type itself and its base DAC extensions from which it is derived
 - DAC extension's base DAC and its base DAC types.
 - Lower level DAC extensions to which the DAC extension is chained.

 ### Terminology

This section is a reminder about the terminology used in the diagnostic description. Feel free to skip it if you are already familiar with it.

A **DAC field property** is any C# property declared in a DAC that have attributes derived from `PX.Data.PXEventSubscriberAttribute`.
Such attributes sometimes are called *Acumatica attributes* for brewity. 

A DAC BQL field is a public abstract class that implements `PX.Data.IBqlField` interface. It usually has a corresponding DAC field property that has the same name but in a different casing. 
Usually, BQL fields use camelCasing and field properites use PascalCasing. Together such pair forms a **DAC field**. Here is an example of a DAC field:
```C#
public class DAC : PXBqlTable
{
	public abstract class orderNbr : PX.Data.BQL.BqlString.Field<orderNbr> { }  // The DAC BQL field

	[PXDBString( IsKey = true, IsUnicode = true, InputMask = ">CCCCCC")]		// The Acumatica attribute
	public virtual string OrderNbr { get; set; }								// The DAC field property 

	// Not a DAC field property at all
	public string SomeProperty  
	{ 
		get; 
		set;
	}
}
```

## Code Fix Description

The code fix adds a missing DAC BQL field to the DAC type near the corresponding DAC field property. The code fix is avalable only for properties with missing DAC BQL fields that are declared
in the DAC or DAC extension type itself. If the DAC field property with missing DAC BQL field is declared in a base type, the error will be reported on the DAC name and the code fix is not available.

### Example of Incorrect Code

```C#
public class DAC : PXBqlTable
{
	[PXDBString( IsKey = true, IsUnicode = true, InputMask = ">CCCCCC")]	// The DAC field property without a corresponding DAC BQL field,
	public virtual string OrderNbr { get; set; }							// the PX1065 error is displayed on "OrderNbr"
}
```

### Example of the Code Fix

```C#
public class DAC : PXBqlTable
{
	public abstract class orderNbr : PX.Data.BQL.BqlString.Field<orderNbr> { }		// Added DAC BQL field

	[PXDBString( IsKey = true, IsUnicode = true, InputMask = ">CCCCCC")]
	public virtual string OrderNbr { get; set; }
}
```
