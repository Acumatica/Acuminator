## Diagnostic Description
Graph event handlers with a weekly typed signature that relies on naming conventions could be converted to graph event handlers with strongly typed generic signature. 
There is nothing wrong with using the Naming Convention Signature for graph event handlers. In some rare scenarios this is the only way to declare an automatically subscribed graph event handler for a cache field. 
For example, for cache fields dynamically generated at runtime. 

However, the strongly typed Generic Signature for graph event handlers provides better type safety and C# compiler checks. It can be used almost interchangeably with the Naming Convention Signature.
Therefore, it is recommended for developers to consider converting their graph event handlers to the Generic Signature. Acuminator provides code fix to do the conversion.

The event handler's signature cannot be safely converted to the Generic Signature in some scenarios related to overriding of other event handler:
  - When event handler is a C# override of the event handler from the base class,
  - When event handler is a graph extension's method with the `PXOverride` attribute and overrides the event handler from the base graph or graph extension,
  - When event handler has more than 2 parameters and overrides the event handler from the base graph or graph extension.

In these scenarios you will need to convert all involved event handlers manually.

## Example of the Graph Event Handler with Naming Convention Signature

```C#
protected virtual void ARInvoice_RefNbr_FieldUpdating(PXCache sender, PXFieldUpdatingEventArgs e)
{
    //...
}
```

## Example of the Graph Event Handler with Generic Signature

```C#
protected virtual void _(Events.FieldUpdating<ARInvoice, ARInvoice.refNbr> e) 
{
    //...
}
```
