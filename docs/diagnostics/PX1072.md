# PX1072
This document describes the PX1072 diagnostic.

## Summary

| Code   | Short Description                                                                  | Type                           | Code Fix  | 
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------- | 
| PX1072 | BQL queries must be executed within the context of an existing `PXGraph` instance. | Warning (ISV Level 1: Significant) | Available | 

## Diagnostic Description
A new `PXGraph` instance should not be used in the execution of BQL queries. Instead, an existing `PXGraph` instance should be used. Because the creation of a `PXGraph` instance is an expensive operation, the instantiation of unnecessary graph instances slows the performance of the application. Also, when you create a new graph, you miss the query results that have already been cached in an existing graph.

The code fix replaces `new PXGraph()` or `PXGraph.CreateInstance<T>()` in the BQL query with the existing `PXGraph` instance of your choice.

The diagnostic also displays the warning when a class contains multiple BQL or Fluent BQL queries and the context contains no available graphs.
The diagnostic considers a graph available in the context if it exists in the context which means a graph is one of the following:
 - A reference to `this` if the diagnostic analyzes the code inside a graph or a graph extension
 - A method parameters of a graph type
 - A local variable of a graph type
 
 > ** NOTE:** Fields or properties of a graph type can also be considered as available graphs, but the diagnostic does not analyze these types of available graphs explicitly and excludes them from the list of available graphs. 

The following code shows an example where diagnostic will display an error because a method contains multiple BQL queries and no available graphs.
```C#
public class CustomerService
{
	public Customer SelectCustomer()
	{
		Customer customer1 = PXSelect<Customer>.Select(new PXGraph());								// Report diagnostic
		Customer customer2 = PXSelect<Customer>.Select(PXGraph.CreateInstance<CustomerMaint>());    // Report diagnostic

		return customer1 ?? customer2;
	}
}
```
In this case, the diagnostic message recommends to create a new local variable for a shared graph.

## Example of Code that Results in the Warning

```C#
public class ARInvoiceEntry : PXGraph<ARInvoiceEntry, ARInvoice>
{
	public ARInvoice GetInvoice(PXGraph graph, string refNbr)
	{
		var invoiceEntry = PXGraph.CreateInstance<ARInvoiceEntry>();

		var invoice = PXSelect<ARInvoice, Where<ARInvoice.refNbr, Equal<Required<ARInvoice.refNbr>>>>
			.Select(new PXGraph(), refNbr); //The PX1072 warning is displayed for this line.
	}
}
```

## Example of Code Fix

```C#
public class ARInvoiceEntry : PXGraph<ARInvoiceEntry, ARInvoice>
{
	public ARInvoice GetInvoice(PXGraph graph, string refNbr)
	{
		var invoiceEntry = PXGraph.CreateInstance<ARInvoiceEntry>();

        //First variant of fix
		var invoice = PXSelect<ARInvoice, Where<ARInvoice.refNbr, Equal<Required<ARInvoice.refNbr>>>>
			.Select(this, refNbr); //`new PXGraph()` is replaced with the `this` instance.
        /*
        // Second variant of fix
        var invoice = PXSelect<ARInvoice, Where<ARInvoice.refNbr, Equal<Required<ARInvoice.refNbr>>>>
			.Select(graph, refNbr); //`new PXGraph()` is replaced with the `graph` instance. 
        // Third variant of fix
        var invoice = PXSelect<ARInvoice, Where<ARInvoice.refNbr, Equal<Required<ARInvoice.refNbr>>>>
			.Select(invoiceEntry, refNbr); //`new PXGraph()` is replaced with the `invoiceEntry` instance. 
        */
	}
}
```
