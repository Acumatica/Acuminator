## Diagnostic Description

`PXSetupNotEnteredException`, which is used to prevent the opening of a form, cannot be thrown in long-running operations.

`PXSetupNotEnteredException` can be thrown as follows:

 - During `PXGraph` initialization
 - In data view delegates
 - In the `RowSelected` event handlers

To prevent the warning from occurring, you should remove the code that throws `PXSetupNotEnteredException` from the code of the long-running operation and rework the related business logic.

## Example of Code That Results in the Warning

```C#
PXLongOperation.Start(() => throw new PXSetupNotEnteredException()); // The PX1086 warning is displayed for this line.
```
