| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------- | 
| PX1006 | The order of view declarations will cause the creation of one cache instance for multiple DACs | Warning (Level 3: Informational) | Unavailable | 

## Diagnostic Description
For inherited DAC types, the order of data view declarations affects the number of `PXCache` instances for these DACs. To have the number of `PXCache` instances equal to the number of the primary DACs, you have to declare the data views in the order of inheritance of the primary DACs: the first data view uses the base DAC, the second data view uses the derived type. To have a shared `PXCache` instance for the base DAC and the derived DAC, you declare the data views in reverse order: the first data view uses the derived DAC, the second data view uses the base DAC.

## Example of the Code That Produces the Warning

```C#
public class BAccount : IBqlTable { }
public class Vendor : BAccount { }
  
public class VendorMaint : PXGraph<VendorMaint, Vendor>
{
    public PXSelect<Vendor> Vendor;
    public PXSelect<BAccount> VendorBAcc;
  
    // One PXCache<Vendor> instance is used for both Vendor and BAccount
}
```
