This document describes the PX1006 diagnostic.

## Summary

| Code   | Short Description                                                                              | Type                             | Code Fix    | 
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------- | 
| PX1006 | The order of view declarations will cause the creation of one cache instance for multiple DACs | Warning (Level 3: Informational) | Unavailable | 

## Diagnostic Description
For inherited DAC types, the order of data view declarations affects the number of `PXCache` instances for these DACs as follows:

 - Two `PXCache` instances are created if you declare the data views so that the first data view uses the base DAC, and the second data view uses the derived type. 
 - A shared `PXCache` instance for the base DAC and the derived DAC is created if you declare the data views so that the first data view uses the derived DAC, and the second data view uses the base DAC.

 To use separate `PXCache` instances, you change the order of data view declarations. If you are using a shared `PXCache` instance, make sure the `PXCache` instance refers to the needed DAC type.

## Example of Code That Results in the Warning

```C#
public class BAccount : IBqlTable { }
public class Vendor : BAccount { }
  
public class VendorMaint : PXGraph<VendorMaint, Vendor> // The PX1006 warning is displayed for this line.
{
    public PXSelect<Vendor> Vendor;
    public PXSelect<BAccount> VendorBAcc;
  
    // One PXCache<Vendor> instance is used for both Vendor and BAccount
}
```
