# PX1099
This document describes the PX1099 diagnostic.

## Summary

| Code   | Short Description                                                            | Type    | Code Fix    | 
| ------ | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------| ------- | ----------- | 
| PX1099 | The API reported by diagnostic should not be used with Acumatica Framework.  | Warning | Unavailable | 

## Diagnostic Description

The API reported by PX1099 diagnostic should not be used with Acumatica Framework. Each banned API may have its own reason for being banned. Next section provides an example of such banned API with `Math.Round` overloads without a specified
midpoint rounding method.

### Banned Math.Round Overloads

By default, the `System.Math.Round` method uses [Banker's rounding](https://docs.alipayplus.com/alipayplus/alipayplus/reconcile_mpp/bank_rounding?role=MPP&product=Payment1&version=1.5.4) that rounds midpoint to the nearest even number.
This means that `12.5` will be rounded to `12` and `13.5` to `14`. This behavior is not compatible with Microsoft Excel rounding that by default uses midpoint rounding away from zero.
It also surprises many developers who expected the rounding to be done with an away from zero method which is more known.

On the other hand, Banker's rounding to even has its own advantages. Away from zero rounding on average has a bigger rounding error than Banker's rounding because more numbers are rounded up than down. 
The rounding error from multiple operations with away from zero rounding on avarage will be bigger.

It is not forbidden to use either type of rounding, but it is important to understand which one is used in the code and to be consistent and explicit with it. Thus the PX1099 diagnostic forbids `Math.Round` method overloads
without a specified midpoint rounding method.

#### Example of Incorrect Code

In the following example, the forbidden overload of the `System.Math.Round` is used. 
```C#
public class MyGraph : PXGraph<MyGraph>
{
	public virtual decimal CalculateCuryAmount(decimal amount, decimal curyRate, int precision)
	{
		// The rounding used by default will be Bankers Rounding that rounds midpoint to the nearest even number. This can be unexepected for developers who expect rounding away from zero.
		return Math.Round(amount * curyRate, precision);   
	}
}
```

#### Example of Correct Code

This example shows how to specify the `Math.Round` method with the `MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero` parameter to round midpoint away from zero.
```C#
public class MyGraph : PXGraph<MyGraph>
{
	public virtual decimal CalculateCuryAmount(decimal amount, decimal curyRate, int precision)
	{
		return Math.Round(amount * curyRate, precision, MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero);   
	}
}
```

## Analysis Overview

The main idea of PX1099 analysis is that all API usages in the checked code are checked against a list of forbidden APIs. The API is reported if one of the following criterias is met:

- API itself is in the list of banned APIs;
- Namespace containing API is in the list of banned APIs;
- One of the types containing API is in the list of banned APIs;
- API is a type and one of its base types is in the list of banned APIs;
- API is a method, property or event, it is an override of a base type member, and one of the overridden members is in the list of banned APIs.

The diagnostic also supports a white list of APIs that are not reported even if they are recognized as forbidden. For example, the analysis reports `System.Environment` type and all its members as forbidden. 
However, the `System.Environment.NewLine` property is whitelisted and is not reported by the PX1099 diagnostic. The whitelist allows to avoid frequently reported false positives and configure analysis more granularly.

## Diagnostic Settings

The PX1099 diagnostic provides advanced configuration options to allow you to customize the diagnostic behavior. You can disable the PX1099 diagnostic or configure custom files with banned and whitelisted APIs.
You can find PX1099 settings in Acuminator sections of Visual Studio settings: `Tools -> Options -> Acuminator -> Banned API`:
![Banned API settings](images/BannedApiSettings.png)

The following settings are available:

- `Enable PX1099 diagnostic for banned API` - enables or disables the PX1099 check. By default, the check is enabled.
- `Banned API File` - specifies the path to the file with banned APIs.
- `White List API File` - specifies the path to the file with whitelisted APIs.

### Banned and Whitelisted APIs

Acuminator comes with default lists of banned and whitelisted APIs. These files are deployed by Acuminator on your machine in the `<My Documents Folder>\Acuminator\Acumatica Banned API` folder. 
The `Banned API File` and `White List API File` settings are initially set to these files. You can modify these files to customize the list of banned and whitelisted APIs.

Note, that clearing `Banned API File` and `White List API File` settings in Visual Studio will not prevent the PX1099 diagnostic from running. The diagnostic will use the default lists of banned and whitelisted APIs that are 
embedded in Acuminator assemblies. To disable PX1099 diagnostic, you need to set the `Enable PX1099 diagnostic for banned API` setting to `false`.

#### Default Banned APIs

Here is the list of the default banned APIs that are included in the Acuminator:

|                           API Name                 | API Type  | API Ban Type |                           Ban Reason                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------- |--------------| --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `System.Math.Round(System.Double)`                 |   Method  |    General   | Math.Round uses Bankers Rounding by default, which rounds to the closest even number.

#### Default Whitelisted APIs

Here is the list of the default whitelisted APIs that are included in the Acuminator:

|             API Name          | API Type  | API Ban Type |
| ----------------------------- | --------- | ------------ |
| `System.Environment.NewLine`  | Property  |   General    |

### API Format

The records in the file with banned APIs have the same API format. Each API record is represented by a single line in the file and consists of three parts separated by whitespace:

- Mandatory API identifier.
- Mandatory API Ban Type that indicates for whom API is banned. There are two available values:
	- `General` indicates that the API is banned for all developers,
	- `ISV` indicates that the API is banned for ISV developers only.
- Optional API Ban Reason string with details why the API is banned.

The API identifier is based on the `DocID` format: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/xmldoc/#id-strings. 
This format is chosen due to its convenience. It is widely used by .Net technology and Roslyn already has a built-in functionality to generate `DocID` for APIs.
However, the Doc ID format was enhanced to store more information about the API:

- In the full API name the namespace part is separated from the containing type names with a special hyphen `-` separator. This allows Acuminator to deduce which part is the namespace. This is impossible for the standard `DocID` format.
  Here is an example:
  ```cs 
  T:System-Environment
  ```
- If the full API name includes nested types, then their names are separated by `+` to simplify the parsing of the API name into parts:
  ```cs
  T:Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc.ModelBinding-ModelStateDictionary+PrefixEnumerable
  ```

File with whitelisted APIs has the same format as the file with banned APIs. However, the "API Ban Type" part while mandatory is ignored by Acuminator. It is recommended to always set it to `General`.
The API Ban Reason is the whitelist file is not used by Acuminator and should be omitted.
