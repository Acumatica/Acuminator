# PX1071
This document describes the PX1071 diagnostic.

## Summary

| Code   | Short Description                                 | Type  | Code Fix    | 
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ----------- | 
| PX1071 | Actions cannot be executed within event handlers. | Error | Unavailable |

## Diagnostic Description
Actions cannot be executed within event handlers. Execution of actions in event handlers brakes the sequence of events, subsequent event handlers can be skipped, which can lead to unpredictable behavior of the system.

To fix the issue, you should remove execution of the action from the event handler and rework the related business logic.

## Example of Incorrect Code

```C#
public class SOOrderEntry : PXGraph<SOOrderEntry, SOOrder>
{
    public PXAction<SOOrder> Release;
 
    protected virtual void SOOrder_RowSelected(PXCache sender, PXRowSelectedEventArgs e)
    {
        Release.Press(); // The PX1071 error is displayed for this line.
        Cancel.Press(new PXAdapter(...)); // Another PX1071 error is displayed for this line.
    }
}
```
