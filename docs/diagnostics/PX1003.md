# PX1003
This document describes the PX1003 diagnostic.

## Summary

| Code   | Short Description                                      | Type                                  | Code Fix    | 
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ----------- | 
| PX1003 | Consider using a specific implementation of `PXGraph`. | Warning (Level 2: Production Quality) | Unavailable |

## Diagnostic Description
To instantiate a graph type from code, you cannot use the graph constructor `new T()`. However, you can use `new PXGraph()` if you select or change records in the system context or generic context and if no specific implementation of `PXGraph` can be used.

If you use `new PXGraph()` instead of the instantiation of an instance of specific graph type, a part of platform-specific logic is omitted, such as the following:

 - Collection and initialization of graph extensions
 - Dependency injection
 - Loading and unloading of the graph state from the session

However, `new PXGraph()` works faster than the instantiation of a specific graph type through the `PXGraph.CreateInstance<T>()` method.

To fix the issue, you should consider replacing `new PXGraph()` with the instantiation of an instance of a specific graph type through the `PXGraph.CreateInstance<T>()` method.

## Example of Code that Results in the Warning

```C#
var graph = new PXGraph(); // The PX1003 warning is displayed for this line.
```
