# PX1003
This document describes the PX1003 diagnostic.

## Summary

| Code   | Message                                               | Type    | Code Fix    | 
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ----------- | 
| PX1003 | Consider using a specific implementation of `PXGraph` | Production quality warning (Level 2) | Unavailable |

## Diagnostic Description
To instantiate a graph type from code, you cannot use the graph constructor `new T()`. However, the use of `new PXGraph()` is possible if you select or change records in the system context or generic context and no specific implementation of `PXGraph` can be used.

If you use `new PXGraph()` instead of an instance of specific graph type, a part of platform-specific logic is ommitted, such as the following:

 - Collection and initialization of graph extensions
 - Dependency injection
 - Loading and unloading of graph state from the session

However, `new PXGraph()` works faster than instantiation of a specific graph type through the `PXGraph.CreateInstance<T>()` method.

## Example of the Code That Produces the Warning

```C#
var graph = new PXGraph();
```
