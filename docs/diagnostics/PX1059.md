# PX1059
This document describes the PX1059 diagnostic.

## Summary

| Code   | Short Description                                                             | Type  | Code Fix    | 
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ----------- | 
| PX1059 | Changes to `PXCache` cannot be performed during the `PXGraph` initialization. | Error | Unavailable |

## Diagnostic Description
Changes to `PXCache` cannot be performed during the `PXGraph` initialization (that is, in `PXGraph` constructors, in the `Initialize` method overridden in `PXGraphExtension`, or in handlers subscribed at run time through the static `InstanceCreated` member of `PXGraph`). 

The diagnostic finds invocations of the following methods:

 - The `Insert`, `Update`, and `Delete` methods of the `PXCache` object
 - The `Insert`, `Update`, and `Delete` methods of decendants of the `PXSelectBase<>` class

The invocation of these methods during the `PXGraph` initialization can lead to data inconsistency.

During the `PXGraph` initialization, you can configure basic UI presentation logic and can make sure that all necessary configuration data for the screen is available. No other business logic should be executed during the `PXGraph` initialization.

To prevent the error from occurring, you should remove from the `PXGraph` initialization the code that changes `PXCache` and rework the related business logic.

## Example of Incorrect Code

```C#
public class SOOrderEntry : PXGraph<SOOrderEntry>
{
    public SOOrderEntry()
    {
        var doc = Orders.Current;
        doc.OrderType = "SO";
        Orders.Cache.Update(doc); //The PX1059 error is displayed for this line.
    }
}
```
