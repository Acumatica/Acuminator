| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------- | 
| PX1016 | A DAC or graph extension must include the public static IsActive method with the bool return type. Extensions which are constantly active reduce performance. Suppress the error if you need the DAC extension to be constantly active. | Error | Available | 

## Diagnostic Description
A DAC or a graph extension must include the public static IsActive method with the bool return type. Extensions which are constantly active reduce performance.

To fix the issue, in the IsActive method, you should enable the DAC or graph extension if the feature for which this extension is needed is enabled. 

## Example of Code that Results in the Error

```C#
// A diagnostic must be shown on SOOrderEntryExt 
public class SOOrderEntryExt : PXGraphExtension<SOOrderEntry>
{
    ...
	// no isActive method
}
```

## Example of Code that Results in the Error

```C#
// A diagnostic must be shown on SOOrderEntryExt 
public class SOOrderEntryExt : PXGraphExtension<SOOrderEntry>
{
    ...
	public static Boolean IsActive() => true;
}
```
