## Diagnostic Description
A DAC or a graph extension must include the public static `IsActive` method with no parameters and the `bool` return type. Extensions that are constantly active reduce performance.

Graph extensions containing an override of the `Configure` method are considered to be special extensions that are used only to specify the screen configuration and workflow:
```C#
public virtual void Configure(PXScreenConfiguration graph) { }
```
The diagnostic does not check such extensions for the `IsActive` method declaration unless they contain business logic elements such as graph actions, views, action and view delegates, graph event handlers, and methods marked with `PXOverrideAttribute`.
The diagnostic also does not report graph and DAC extensions in following cases:
- Graph or DAC extension is a generic class.
- DAC extension is an abstract class.
- Graph extension is an abstract class, and it does not have `PXProtectedAccessAttribute` on the class declaration. Abstract graph extensions with the `PXProtectedAccess` attribute are checked.

You can use two approaches to fix the issue in the `IsActive` method as described in the following sections.

### Suppression Comment 
If you want your DAC or graph extension to be always enabled, suppress the diagnostic with the suppression comment:
```C#
// Acuminator disable once PX1016 ExtensionDoesNotDeclareIsActiveMethod extension should be constantly active
public class SOOrderEntryExt : PXGraphExtension<SOOrderEntry>
{
    ...
}
```
It is a well-known suppression case, therefore Acuminator will generate a default justification _extension should be constantly active_ for the suppression.
Do not add a trivial `IsActive` method implementation as shown in the following code. Such implementation will take a small performance cost from your application without any benefit.
```C#
public class POOrderEntryExt : PXGraphExtension<POOrderEntry>
{
   public static bool IsActive() => true;   // Do not add such trivial implementations, suppress PX1016 diagnostic instead
}
```

### IsActive Method Implementation 
If your a DAC or graph extension should be enabled depending on a condition, implement the `IsActive` method. For example, you can enable an extension, if the feature for which this extension is needed is enabled, as shown in the following code.
```C#
public class SOOrderEntryExt : PXGraphExtension<SOOrderEntry>
{
    ...
	public static bool IsActive() => PXAccess.FeatureInstalled<FeaturesSet.retainage>();
}
```

## Example of Code that Results in the Error
```C#
// A diagnostic must be shown on SOOrderEntryExt 
public class SOOrderEntryExt : PXGraphExtension<SOOrderEntry>
{
    ...
	// no isActive method
}
```

## Example of the Fixed Code
If you need an extension to be always enabled, suppress the diagnostic as shown in the following code.
```C#
// Acuminator disable once PX1016 ExtensionDoesNotDeclareIsActiveMethod extension should be constantly active
public class SOOrderEntryExt : PXGraphExtension<SOOrderEntry>
{
    ...
}
```

If extension should be enabled depending on condition, implement the `IsActive` method as shown in the following code.
```C#
public class SOOrderEntryExt : PXGraphExtension<SOOrderEntry>
{
    ...
	public static bool IsActive() => PXAccess.FeatureInstalled<FeaturesSet.retainage>();
}
```
