| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------- | 
| PX1016 | A DAC or graph extension must include the public static `IsActive` method with no parameters and the `bool` return type. Extensions that are constantly active reduce performance. Suppress the error if you need the DAC extension to be constantly active. | Error | Unavailable | 

## Diagnostic Description
A DAC or a graph extension must include the public static `IsActive` method with no parameters and the `bool` return type. Extensions that are constantly active reduce performance.

To fix the issue, in the `IsActive` method, you should enable the DAC or graph extension if the feature for which this extension is needed is enabled. 

In case you do not want to define the `IsActive` method as suggested above, you should suppress the diagnostic for better performance, otherwise the `IsActive` method will be called constantly to check whether the extension is enabled.

## Example of Code that Results in the Error

```C#
// A diagnostic must be shown on SOOrderEntryExt 
public class SOOrderEntryExt : PXGraphExtension<SOOrderEntry>
{
    ...
	// no isActive method
}
```

## Example of the Fixed Code

```C#
public class SOOrderEntryExt : PXGraphExtension<SOOrderEntry>
{
    ...
	public static bool IsActive() { return PXAccess.FeatureInstalled<FeaturesSet.retainage>(); }
}
```
