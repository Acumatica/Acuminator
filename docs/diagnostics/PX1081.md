# PX1081
This document describes the PX1081 diagnostic.

## Summary

| Code   | Short Description                                               | Type  | Code Fix    | 
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ----------- | 
| PX1081 | Actions cannot be executed during the `PXGraph` initialization. | Error | Unavailable |

## Diagnostic Description
Actions cannot be executed during the `PXGraph` initialization (that is, in `PXGraph` constructors, in the `Initialize` method overridden in `PXGraphExtension`, or handlers subscribed at run time through the static `InstanceCreated` member of `PXGraph`). During the `PXGraph` initialization, the `PXGraph` is not yet ready for execution of the actions. 

During `PXGraph` initialization, you can configure basic UI presentation logic and can make sure that all necessary configuration data for the screen is available. Any other business logic should not be executed during the `PXGraph` initialization.

Actions can be executed in the following places:

 - Another action delegate
 - Processing delegates: `PXLongOperation.StartOperation()` and `PXProcessingBase.SetProcessDelegate()`
 - The `PXGraph.Persist()` method
 - `FieldUpdated` and `RowUpdated` event handlers
 - Contract-based API endpoint adapters
 - The `PXGraph.ExecuteUpdate` method

To fix the issue, you should remove from the `PXGraph` initialization the code that executes an action and rework the related business logic.

## Example of Incorrect Code

```C#
public class SOOrderEntry : PXGraph<SOOrderEntry, SOOrder>
{
    public PXAction<SOOrder> Release;
    ...
    public SOOrderEntry()
    {
        Release.Press(); // The PX1081 error is displayed for this line.
        Cancel.Press(new PXAdapter(...)); // Another PX1081 error is displayed for this line.
    }
}
```
