# PX1081
This document describes the PX1081 diagnostic.

## Summary

| Code   | Short Description                                               | Type  | Code Fix    | 
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ----------- | 
| PX1081 | Actions cannot be executed during the `PXGraph` initialization. | Error | Unavailable |

## Diagnostic Description
Actions cannot be executed during the `PXGraph` initialization (that is, in `PXGraph` constructors, in the `Initialize` method overridden in `PXGraphExtension`, or handlers subscribed at run time through the static `InstanceCreated` member of `PXGraph`).

To fix the issue, you should remove the code that executes an action from a `PXGraph` constructor or the `Initialize` method overridden in a graph extension and rework the related business logic.

## Example of Incorrect Code

```C#
public class SOOrderEntry : PXGraph<SOOrderEntry, SOOrder>
{
    public PXAction<SOOrder> Release;
    ...
    public SOOrderEntry()
    {
        Release.Press(); // The PX1081 error is displayed for this line.
        Cancel.Press(new PXAdapter(...)); // Another PX1081 error is displayed for this line.
    }
}
```
