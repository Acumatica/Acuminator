# PX1057
This document describes the PX1057 diagnostic.

## Summary

| Code   | Short Description                                                                                 | Type  | Code Fix    | 
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ----------- | 
| PX1057 | A `PXGraph` instance cannot be initialized while another `PXGraph` instance is being initialized. | Error | Unavailable |

## Diagnostic Description
A `PXGraph` instance cannot be initialized while another `PXGraph` instance is being initialized (that is, in constructors of another `PXGraph` instance or in the `Initialize` method overridden in an extension of another `PXGraph` instance).

To fix the issue, you should remove the initialization of the `PXGraph` instance from the `PXGraph` constructor or the `Initialize` method overridden in a graph extension and rework the related business logic.

## Example of Incorrect Code

```C#
public class DocCustomerExtensionMaint : PXGraph<DocCustomerExtensionMaint>
{
    public DocCustomerExtensionMaint()
    {
        DocConnMaint maint = PXGraph.CreateInstance<DocConnMaint>(); // The PX1057 error is displayed for this line.
    }
}
```
