# PX1004
This document describes the PX1004 diagnostic.

## Summary

| Code   | Short Description                                                              | Type    | Code Fix    | 
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- | ----------- | 
| PX1004 | The order of view declarations will cause the creation of two cache instances. | Message | Unavailable | 

## Diagnostic Description
For inherited DAC types, the order of the data view declarations affects the number of `PXCache` instances for these DACs as follows:

 - Two `PXCache` instances are created if you declare the data views so that the first data view uses the base DAC, and the second data view uses the derived type. 
 - A shared `PXCache` instance for the base DAC and the derived DAC is created if you declare the data views so that the first data view uses the derived DAC, and the second data view uses the base DAC.

The diagnostic works for graphs and graph extensions.

In most cases, you do not need to do anything with this message. If you want to use a shared `PXCache` instance for the base DAC and the derived DAC, you can change the order of the data view declarations. However, if you use a shared `PXCache` instance, make sure the `PXCache` instance refers to the needed DAC type.

## Example of Code That Results in the Warning

```C#
public class BAccount : IBqlTable { }
public class Customer : BAccount { }

public class CustomerMaint : PXGraph<CustomerMaint, Customer> // The PX1004 warning is displayed for this line.
{
    public PXSelect<BAccount> CustomerBAcc; 
    public PXSelect<Customer> Customer;
 
    // Two cache instances (PXCache<BAccount> and PXCache<Customer>) are created.
}
```
