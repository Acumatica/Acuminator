This document describes the PX1004 diagnostic.

## Summary

| Code   | Message                                                                       | Type                             | Code Fix    | 
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------- | 
| PX1004 | The order of view declarations will cause the creation of two cache instances | Warning (Level 3: Informational) | Unavailable | 

## Diagnostic Description
For inherited DAC types, the order of data view declarations affects the number of `PXCache` instances for these DACs. To have the number of `PXCache` instances equal to the number of the primary DACs, you have to declare the data views in the order of inheritance of the primary DACs: the first data view uses the base DAC, the second data view uses the derived type. To have a shared `PXCache` instance for the base DAC and the derived DAC, you declare the data views in reverse order: the first data view uses the derived DAC, the second data view uses the base DAC.

## Example of the Code That Produces the Warning

```C#
public class BAccount : IBqlTable { }
public class Customer : BAccount { }

public class CustomerMaint : PXGraph<CustomerMaint, Customer>
{
    public PXSelect<BAccount> CustomerBAcc;
    public PXSelect<Customer> Customer;
 
    // Two cache instances (PXCache<BAccount> and PXCache<Customer>) are created
}
```
