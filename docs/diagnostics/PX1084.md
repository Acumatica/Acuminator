# PX1084
This document describes the PX1084 diagnostic.

## Summary

| Code   | Short Description                                                     | Type  | Code Fix    | 
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | ----------- | 
| PX1084 | `PXGraph` instances cannot be initialized within data view delegates. | Error | Unavailable |

## Diagnostic Description
`PXGraph` instances cannot be initialized within data view delegates. The initialization of complicated graphs in data view delegates affects the performance of the application. Also, when you create a new graph, you miss the query results that have already been cached in an existing graph.

To prevent the error from occurring, you should remove the creation of a `PXGraph` instance from the data view delegate and rework the related business logic.

## Example of Incorrect Code

```C#
public class ShipmentProcess : PXGraph<ShipmentProcess>
{
    [PXFilterable]
    public PXFilteredProcessingJoin<SOShipment, ShipFilter,
    LeftJoin<Customer,
        On<SOShipment.customerID, Equal<Customer.bAccountID>>>,
    Where<CustomerExtension.sCust, Equal<True>,
        And<CustomerExtension.sReq, Equal<True>>>>
    ShipmentList;

    protected virtual IEnumerable shipmentList()
    {
        var sel = new PXSelectJoin<SOShipment,
            InnerJoin<BAccount,
                On<SOShipment.customerID,
                    Equal<BAccount.bAccountID>>>>(this);

        var orderMaint = PXGraph.CreateInstance<SOOrderEntry>(); //The PX1084 error is displayed for this line.
        return sel.Select();
    }
}
```
